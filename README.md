# Cruise-Control-System

Cruise control (sometimes known as speed control or autocruise, or tempomat in some countries) is a system that automatically controls the speed of a motor vehicle. The system is a servomechanism that takes over the throttle of the car to maintain a steady speed as set by the driver. The driver must bring the vehicle up to speed manually and use a button to set the cruise control to the current speed.

In this project, we are simulating the working of such system using MATLAB/SIMULINK.

Assumptions of our model:-
1. For simplicity, we have used a brushed DC motor on place of a 3 phase 4 pole induction motor.
2. The gear ratio of electric vehicle is assumed to be 9.73:1
3. There is no slipping between tyres and Road.
4. Nominal Battery Voltage is taken as 3.6 Volts.
5. The weight of the vehicle is taken as 2108kg.
